CHISNOW - SESSION 1 PROGRESS SUMMARY
Initializer Agent - 2025-12-04 (UPDATED)
===========================================

## COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Brainstorming & Design (✓ Complete)
- Used brainstorming skill to refine ChiSnow concept with Kyle
- Asked clarifying questions about:
  * User experience (quick check vs exploration)
  * Data scope (recent + short history for MVP)

  * User accounts (public only for MVP)
  * Device priority (mobile-first)
  * Tech stack (React + TypeScript confirmed)
  * Visualization style (both heatmap + markers)
  * Model comparison feature (add later, not in MVP)
- Verified API availability:
  * NOAA NWS API: ✓ Public and free
  * NOAA Gridded Snowfall Analysis: ✓ Public via MapServer
