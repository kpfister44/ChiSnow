===========================================
CHISNOW - SESSION 1 PROGRESS SUMMARY
Initializer Agent - 2025-12-04
===========================================

## COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Brainstorming & Design (✓ Complete)
- Used brainstorming skill to refine ChiSnow concept with Kyle
- Asked clarifying questions about:
  * User experience (quick check vs exploration)
  * Data scope (recent + short history for MVP)
  * Update timing (post-storm for MVP, live updates later)
  * User accounts (public only for MVP)
  * Device priority (mobile-first)
  * Tech stack (React + TypeScript confirmed)
  * Visualization style (both heatmap + markers)
  * Model comparison feature (add later, not in MVP)
- Verified API availability:
  * NOAA NWS API: ✓ Public and free
  * NOAA Gridded Snowfall Analysis: ✓ Public via MapServer
  * CoCoRaHS: ⚠️ Requires access request (plan to add later)
- Decision: Start MVP with 2 public APIs, add CoCoRaHS as v1.1

### 2. Project Specification (✓ Complete)
- Created comprehensive app_spec.txt following Kyle's example format
- Includes:
  * Complete technology stack
  * Detailed core features breakdown
  * API endpoint specifications with data formats
  * UI layout for mobile and desktop
  * Design system with specific hex codes for snowfall gradient
  * Key user interaction flows
  * 6 implementation steps with specific tasks
  * Success criteria (functionality, UX, technical quality, performance)

### 3. Feature List (✓ Complete)
- Created feature_list.json with 100 comprehensive test cases
- Categories: functional (majority) and style
- Mix of narrow tests (2-7 steps) and comprehensive tests (10+ steps)
- At least 15 tests have 10+ steps each for thorough coverage
- Features ordered by priority:
  1. API routes and data fetching
  2. Core map interface
  3. Visualization layers (heatmap + markers)
  4. Storm selection and history
  5. Responsive design and mobile optimization
  6. Performance and accessibility
  7. Deployment and DevOps
- ALL tests start with "passes": false as required
- Covers EVERY feature from app_spec.txt exhaustively

### 4. Development Setup (✓ Complete)
- Created init.sh script that:
  * Checks for Node.js 18+
  * Detects package manager (pnpm or npm)
  * Creates .env.local template if missing
  * Installs dependencies
  * Starts development server with helpful info
  * Made executable (chmod +x)

### 5. Git Repository (✓ Complete)
- Initialized git repository
- Created .gitignore for Next.js project (node_modules, .next, .env, etc.)
- Created comprehensive README.md with:
  * Project overview and features
  * Tech stack details
  * Quick start guide
  * Available scripts
  * Project structure diagram
  * Deployment instructions
  * Performance targets
  * Future enhancements
- Made initial commit with all setup files:
  * feature_list.json (100 test cases)
  * init.sh (setup script)
  * README.md
  * .gitignore
  * app_spec.txt
  * CLAUDE.md
  * Prompts/initializer_prompt.md

### 6. Project Structure (✓ Complete)
- Created directory structure:
  * app/ - Next.js App Router pages
  * app/api/snowfall/ - API routes
  * components/ - React components
  * lib/ - Utility functions
  * types/ - TypeScript definitions
  * public/ - Static assets
  * Prompts/ - Agent prompts

## WHAT'S READY FOR NEXT AGENT

### Ready to Use
1. ✓ feature_list.json - Complete test suite (100 tests, all pass: false)
2. ✓ init.sh - Working setup script
3. ✓ README.md - Full documentation
4. ✓ app_spec.txt - Complete specification
5. ✓ Git repo initialized with clean history
6. ✓ Directory structure created

### Next Steps for Implementation
The next agent should follow implementation steps from app_spec.txt:

**STEP 1: Project Setup and API Integration**
- Initialize Next.js 14+ project (npx create-next-app@latest)
- Install dependencies: mapbox-gl, tailwindcss
- Configure TypeScript and Tailwind
- Implement /api/snowfall/latest endpoint
- Connect to NOAA NWS API
- Connect to NOAA Gridded API
- Build data normalization logic
- Add in-memory caching (2-hour TTL)
- Write unit tests

**STEP 2: Core Map Interface**
- Install and configure Mapbox GL JS
- Create SnowfallMap component
- Set up Chicago default view
- Implement pan/zoom controls
- Add touch gesture support
- Create loading/error states

Continue through remaining steps in app_spec.txt...

## IMPORTANT NOTES FOR NEXT AGENT

1. **Feature List is Sacred**: NEVER remove or edit features in feature_list.json.
   Only mark "passes": false → "passes": true when fully tested.

2. **API Keys Needed**: Next agent will need to get Mapbox API key
   - Free tier: https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/
   - Add to .env.local as NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN

3. **Data Sources**:
   - NOAA NWS API: api.weather.gov (no key needed)
   - NOAA Gridded: mapservices.weather.noaa.gov (no key needed)
   - CoCoRaHS: Will need to request access (future)

4. **Testing Requirements**:
   - API routes: 80%+ coverage
   - Utilities: 80%+ coverage
   - Components: 50%+ coverage
   - Focus on stateful components

5. **Performance Targets**:
   - Page load: <2s on 3G
   - Lighthouse: 90+ performance, accessibility
   - Bundle: <500KB gzipped

6. **Mobile-First**: Always design for mobile first, then desktop

7. **Follow CLAUDE.md**: Strict adherence to Kyle's development rules
   - TDD for all features
   - Commit frequently
   - No skipping pre-commit hooks
   - Match existing code style
